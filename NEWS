Functions and datasets to support Smilde, NÃ¦s and Liland (2022, ISBN: 978-1-119-60096-1) 
"Multiblock Data Fusion in Statistics and Machine Learning - Applications in the Natural and Life Sciences". 
This implements and imports a large collection of methods for multiblock data analysis with common interfaces, result- and plotting 
functions, several real data sets and six vignettes covering a range different applications.

##### Version 0.8.4
Date: 20 February 2023
>> Corrected GCA (gca) outputs by removing blockLoadings, adding blockDecomp and exchanging blockCoef.
>> Added support for setting number of components per block in GCA.
>> Fixed bug in MB-PLS (mbpls) when blockscale="none" (thanks to GitHub user flomehl).
>> Corrected scaling of response in SO-PLS-PM (sopls_pm).

##### Version 0.8.3
Date: 29 October 2022
>> Added options for various block weights in MB-PLS and sMB-PLS.
>> Added correlation loading plots (corrplot).
>> Improved feedback for score- and loadingplot for SO-PLS.
>> Added possibility of plotting scores from multiple blocks for SO-PLS.
>> Changed computations of explained variances for DISCO.
>> Fixed wrong fitted values for SO-PLS model with 1 component in first block.

##### Version 0.8.2
Date: 06 June 2022
>> Changed default behaviour of sopls_pm to simultaneously orthogonalise on intermediate blocks instead of orthogonalising sequentially. Legacy behaviour (used in some papers) can be obtained by setting simultaneous=FALSE.
>> Changed default interface of MB-PLS, sMB-PLS and MB-RDA to use formula, but retained backward compatibility with new arguments X and Y.
>> Changed internal handling of X-list in SO-PLS/ROSA to improve naming (excluding block names in variables).

##### Version 0.8.1
Date: 28 December 2021
>> Added NEWS to package.
>> Improved documentation of PCA-GCA.
>> Changed ROSA default argument internal.validation=FALSE.

##### Version 0.8.0
Date: 07 September 2021
>> Initial CRAN release of package multiblock.
